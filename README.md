# WordPress-Brute-Force-Attack-Project
This repository documents my project on conducting brute force attacks on a WordPress installation hosted on an Ubuntu server. The project involves the following steps:

Setting Up WordPress:

Installed a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) on an Ubuntu server.
Downloaded and configured WordPress for a local environment.
User Management:

Added multiple users to the MySQL database to simulate different login credentials.
Configured user roles and permissions within WordPress.
Brute Force Attack Simulation:

Used Hydra on Kali Linux to perform brute force attacks against the WordPress login page.
Tested various attack methods to evaluate the strength of passwords and the effectiveness of security plugins.
Analysis and Recommendations:

Analyzed the results to identify vulnerabilities and potential security breaches.
Provided recommendations for hardening WordPress security against brute force attacks.
This project serves as an educational for understanding WordPress vulnerabilities and implementing effective security measures.
